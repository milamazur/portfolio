            <h3>HOBBY</h3>
        </div>
        <div alt="page-content">
            <p>I like to get away for a long weekend, visit some museums, preferably next to the beach. And in the evenings I would stay in with a good book, some music, a glass of red wine.</p>

                <h2>ART</h2>
                <p>I am one of the lucky people who got to make their hobby into their profession. Both as a painter and a graphic designer I do what I love. The only problem is when I am doing one, I can't be doing the other.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>BOOKS</h2>
                <p>Reading books is my number one activity when I want to relax. As a true book worm I read whenever it's possible. I love to read in different languages, preferrably the original version, and ALWAYS before seeing the movie! I am a massive fan of classic English literature e.g. The Bronte sisters and Thomas Hardy. However I don't shy away from a commercial</p>

                <h2>TRAVEL</h2>
                <p>My parents passed on me their love for travel. I have vistied so many countries. Most as a tourist, some as a resident. My favorit destination is the sun. Bonus points to everything related to antient history (especially Egyptian and Greek) and beautiful landscapes.</p>

                <h2>MUSIC</h2>
                <p>Music has always been there for me. I attended music school and learned how to master the piano. You will find me listening to the same tracks over and over again. Especially the music that makes you feel, like soundtracks. In general everything that incorporates classical instuments in more modern music.</p>
